With these scripts it is possible to find a counterexample to Kaplansky's unit conjecture. The inspiration for this method comes from Giles Gardams experiment in 2021.
To run experiment run the following scripts in this order:
1) Generating balls in P and finding equals.ipynb
2) Generating clauses depending on n.ipynb
3) Simple SAT on clauses depending on n.ipynb

The file: Calculations in F_2 P and translation btw SAT and F_2 P.ipynb contains an environment mimicng F_2 P
The other scripts are not essential, but represent other approaches to SAT.

Files B.txt and model.txt are included for easy acsses to run the script Calculations in F_2 P and translation btw SAT and F_2 P.ipynb.
